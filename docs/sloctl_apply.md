## sloctl apply

Apply object definition in YAML or JSON format

### Synopsis

The apply command commits the changes by sending the updates to the application.
Sloctl supports glob patterns when using '-f' flag, it uses the standard Go glob patterns grammar and extends it with support of '**' for recursive reading of files and directories.
The standard Go grammar can be found here: https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match.
Only files with extensions: '.yaml', '.yml' and '.json' are processed when using glob patterns.
Additionally, before processing the file contents, sloctl checks if it contains Nobl9 API version with the following regex: '"?apiVersion"?\s*:\s*"?n9'.
Remember that glob patterns must be quoted to prevent the shell from evaluating them.


```
sloctl apply [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Apply the configuration from slo.yaml.
sloctl apply -f ./slo.yaml

# Apply resources from multiple different sources at once.
sloctl apply -f ./slo.yaml -f test/config.yaml -f https://nobl9.com/slo.yaml

# Apply the YAML or JSON passed directly into stdin.
cat slo.yaml | sloctl apply -f -

# Apply the configuration from slo.yaml and set project if it is not defined in file.
sloctl apply -f ./slo.yaml -p slo

# Apply the configurations from all the files located at cwd recursively.
sloctl apply -f '**'

# Apply the configurations from files with 'annotations' name within the whole directory tree.
sloctl apply -f '**/annotations*'

# Apply the SLO(s) from slo.yaml and import its/their data from 2023-03-02T15:00:00Z until now.
sloctl apply -f ./slo.yaml --replay --from=2023-03-02T15:00:00Z

```
