## sloctl delete

Delete object definition by name or definition file

### Synopsis

One or more definitions can be specified by name or provide a path to file with definitions to remove.
Sloctl supports glob patterns when using '-f' flag, it uses the standard Go glob patterns grammar and extends it with support of '**' for recursive reading of files and directories.
The standard Go grammar can be found here: https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match.
Only files with extensions: '.yaml', '.yml' and '.json' are processed when using glob patterns.
Additionally, before processing the file contents, sloctl checks if it contains Nobl9 API version with the following regex: '"?apiVersion"?\s*:\s*"?n9'.
Remember that glob patterns must be quoted to prevent the shell from evaluating them.


```
sloctl delete [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Delete the configuration from slo.yaml.
sloctl delete -f ./slo.yaml

# Delete resources from multiple different sources at once.
sloctl delete -f ./slo.yaml -f test/config.yaml -f https://nobl9.com/slo.yaml

# Delete the YAML or JSON passed directly into stdin.
cat slo.yaml | sloctl delete -f -

# Delete by passing in one or more resource names.
sloctl delete slo my-slo-name

# Delete the configuration from slo.yaml and set project context if it is not defined in file.
sloctl delete -f ./slo.yaml -p slo

# Delete the configurations from all the files located at cwd recursively.
sloctl delete -f '**'

# Delete the configurations from files with 'annotations' name within the whole directory tree.
sloctl delete -f '**/annotations*'

```
