# Release process

The internal release process is described in great detail
[here](http://go/sloctl-release).

## Release automation details

We're using [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter)
to automate release notes creation. Drafter also does its best to propose
the next release version based on commit messages from `main` branch.

Release Drafter is also responsible for auto-labeling pull requests.
It checks both title and body of the pull request and adds appropriate labels. \
**NOTE:** The auto-labeling mechanism will not remove labels once they're
created. For example, If you end up changing PR title from `sec:` to `fix:`
you'll have to manually remove `security` label.

On each commit to `main` branch, Release Drafter will update the next release
draft.

In addition to Release Drafter, we're also running a script which extracts
explicitly listed release notes and breaking changes which are optionally
defined in `## Release Notes` and `## Breaking Changes` headers.
It also performs a cleanup of the PR draft mitigating Release Drafter
shortcomings.
