## sloctl get alerts

Displays all of the Alerts.

### Synopsis

Get alerts based on search criteria. You can use specific criteria using flags to find alerts related to specific SLO, objective, service, alert policy, time range, or alert status.

For example, you can use the same flag multiple times to find alerts triggered for a given SLO OR another SLO. Keep in mind that the different types of flags are linked by the AND logical operator.

Only alerts triggered in given project only (alert project is the same as the SLO project). If you don't have permission to view SLO in a given project, alerts from that project will not be returned.



```
sloctl get alerts [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Get all alerts triggered in my organization (max 1000).
