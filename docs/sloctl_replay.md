## sloctl replay

Retrieve historical SLI data and recalculate their SLO error budgets.

### Synopsis

Replay pulls in the historical data while your SLO collects new data in real-time. The historical and current data are merged, producing an error budget calculated for the entire period. Refer to https://docs.nobl9.com/Features/replay?_highlight=replay for more details on Replay.

The 'replay' command allows you to import data for multiple SLOs in bulk. Before running the Replays it will verify if the SLOs you've provided are eligible for Replay. It will only run a single Replay simultaneously (current limit for concurrent Replays). When any Replay fails, it will attempt the import for the next SLO. Importing data takes time: Replay for a single SLO may take several minutes up to an hour. During that time, the command keeps on running, periodically checking the status of Replay. If you cancel the program execution at any time, the current Replay in progress will not be revoked.

```
sloctl replay [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Replay SLO 'my-slo' in Project 'my-project' data from 2023-03-02 15:00:00 UTC until now.
sloctl replay -p my-project --from=2023-03-02T15:00:00Z my-slo

# Replay SLOs using file configuration from replay.yaml
sloctl replay -f ./replay.yaml

# Read the configuration from stdin.
sloctl replay <./replay.yaml

# If the project is not set, it is inferred from Nobl9 config.toml for the current context.
# If 'from' is not provided in the config file, you must specify it with '--from' flag.
# Setting 'project' or 'from' via flags does not take precedence over the values set in config.
cat <<EOF | sloctl replay --from=2023-03-02T15:00:00Z
- slo: prometheus-latency
  from: 2023-03-02T16:00:00Z
- slo: datadog-latency
  project: default
- slo: dynatrace-latency
  project: default
  from: 2023-03-02T16:00:00Z
EOF

# Minimal config with project and from set via flags.
cat <<EOF | sloctl replay -p my-project --from 2023-03-02T15:00:00Z
- slo: prometheus-latency
- slo: datadog-latency
EOF

```

### Options

```
  -f, --file stringArray   File path, glob pattern or a URL to the configuration in YAML or JSON format. This option can be used multiple times.
      --from time          Sets the start of Replay time window.
  -h, --help               help for replay
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -A, --all-projects     Displays the objects from all of the projects.
      --config string    Config file path.
  -c, --context string   Overrides the default context for the duration of the selected command.
      --no-config-file   Don't create config.toml, operate only on env variables.
  -p, --project string   Overrides the default project from active Delete for the duration of the selected command.
